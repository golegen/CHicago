## What is CHicago?

CHicago is a operating that i have been developing since 2018 (ok, the original prototypes dates back to 2013, but anyway, this development of this version started in 2018), it's made to look modern and fast (even if for now it doesn't have a GUI), for now, it only supports x86 (also can boot in x86-64 UEFI), but in the future it will boot in ARM as well.

## Building the ISO

For building the ISO from scratch, you need:

	A Unix-like environment
	GCC and G++
	Make
	Bison
	Flex
	GMP
	MPFR
	MPC
	Texinfo
	Xorriso
	GNU-EFI (for EFI variants, like x86_32 or x86_64)
	MTools (for EFI variants, like x86_32 or x86_64)

To build it, go to the root directory and type:

	make

You can append ARCH=\<ARCH\> and SUBARCH=\<SUBARCH\> to change the system architecture, BUILD_CORES=\<CORES_AMOUNT\> to build the toolchain with multiple cores, VERBOSE=true to enable verbose build (good for finding compilation errors) and DEBUG=yes to disable optimizations and make a debug build.

After building everything, you should have your toolchain inside of the toolchain/\<ARCH\> folder and the bootable iso inside of the build folder (chicago-\<ARCH\>_\<SUBARCH\>.iso).
